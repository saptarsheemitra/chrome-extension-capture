# Element Capture Extension

The Element Capture Extension is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to capture the content of elements on a webpage and save them for later use. You can capture the content of any element on the page by hovering over it and pressing a keyboard shortcut.

## Installation

To install the Element Capture Extension, follow these steps:

1. Download the extension files from the GitHub repository.
2. Extract the files to a folder on your computer.
3. Open Google Chrome and go to the extensions settings page by typing `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
4. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner of the page.
5. Click on the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner of the page.
6. Select the folder where you extracted the extension files and click "Select".
7. The Element Capture Extension should now be installed and ready to use.

**Note:** When you push the files to your own GitHub repository, OpenAI will disable the API key used in this extension. You will need to replace the OpenAI API key with your own key in the `popup.js` file.
